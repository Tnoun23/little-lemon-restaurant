/* (1. FETCHING & SORTING THE FOOD MENU)
 Step 1: Creating menu models

 Create the models that are necessary to map the JSON you get from the link above:

 Create two struct models in two separate swift files. Call one of them "MenuList" and another "MenuItem". Make both of the structs conform to the Decodable protocol.

 Inside the MenuList struct create a single constant property called menu that will hold the Array of MenuItem objects.
 Inside the MenuItem struct, declare three constant properties: title, image and price, all of type String.
 (Optional) There are more than 3 properties in the menu JSON data, and they are just ignored at the moment. You can optionally add them as well in your model like description etc.
